In this article is explained how to add social metadata for a html page. This metadata is used for showing nice description boxes in social networks when you share a link on them.

##Code
Paste the following code in the html head section. You may replace the contents like author data and page descriptions by your own ones.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/edwrodrig/39b3fda59d94aececb73.js"></script>

##Validation tools
There are links to validation tools for the main social meta tags.

* [Facebook Open Graph](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/)
* [Twitter Card Validator](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/validation/validator)
* [Google](http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/richsnippets)

##Notes
When you make a change of some meta tag content it's recommended to re-test it with the validation tools. At least Facebook recognizes new metadata if you reload a page with its validation tool.
