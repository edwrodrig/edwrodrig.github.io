I found problems to organize my Qt unit test in multiple classes. Some macros like `QTEST_APPLESS_MAIN` forces you to have one project per unit test class, and maintaining this could be a headache. If you are using c++11 you can take advantage of lambda functions to get rid of this problem with little code.

##Code

There is the magic:
